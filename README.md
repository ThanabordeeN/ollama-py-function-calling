# Ollama Chat Assistant with WeatherAPI Integration
### Experimental
## Project Description
This project is an experimental chat application that utilizes the Ollama framework to create a conversational interface. The chat assistant is designed to autonomously consider the use of tools, such as the WeatherAPI, to provide users with weather forecasts.

## Features
- **Ollama Framework**: Leverages the Ollama framework for managing chat conversations.
- **WeatherAPI Integration**: Uses WeatherAPI to fetch weather forecasts for user-specified locations and durations.
- **JSON Interaction**: Interacts with users through JSON-formatted messages to process weather forecast requests.
- **Chat History Management**: Maintains a history of the chat conversation, which can be cleaned and parsed as needed.

## How To Use

To get started with the Weather Forecast Chat Assistant, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Obtain an API key from WeatherAPI and add it to the `.env` file with the variable name `WEATHER_API_KEY`. Your `.env` file should look like this:
      ```
      RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
      ```

2. **Model Setup**:
    - Ensure you have the `ollama` package installed. If not, install it using pip:
      ```bash
      pip install ollama
      ```
    - Pull the latest model from the Ollama framework as per the documentation provided by Ollama.

3. **Running the Application**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing the `chat.py` file.
    - Run the chat application using the following command:
      ```bash
      python chat.py
      ```

By following these steps, you'll be able to interact with the chat assistant and receive weather forecasts for your desired location and time frame.

## How It Works
1. Users start a chat session and input their requests in a JSON format.
2. The chat assistant processes the request, calls the `forecast_Weather` function with the provided parameters, and returns the current temperature.
3. The chat history is saved and can be used to review past interactions.

## Getting Started
To use this chat assistant, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Ensure you have the `ollama` package and the `forecast_Weather` function available in your environment.

## Usage
Run the chat application and follow the on-screen prompts to input your weather forecast request in the specified JSON format.
